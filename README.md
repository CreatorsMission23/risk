# About Church Intelligence Agency
This repository will used to gather and distribute intelligence about the Bluegrass Genocide and the CIA's church massacres. We will keep track of churches whom are in the cross-hairs so that they can be proactive in the security of their congregations. I will be relying heavily on volunteers since my communications are suspect at best.

## Altered Modus Operandi 
* The group previously amassed outside of a church prior to after noon attack, at the end of Sunday morning worship service.
* New tactic is to attend services, then interrupt and take control of building.
* Churches need to pay attention to large numbers of male visitors without a church.
* Fellowshipping with another church?     -  Churches should first check the visiting churches bona fides (if they're unknown to the host church).
     - Churches need to NEVER accept a group from a previously attacked church!
